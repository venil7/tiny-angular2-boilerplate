#Tiny Angular2, Webpack and Babeljs project boilerplate

unlike other examples this one doesnt use TypeScript, but rather pure ES6 syntax,
compiled by Babeljs

### to run

 - clone this repo
 - `$ npm install`
 - `$ npm start`
 - navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

### motivation

I was struggling to find any example on the internet of how to run Angular2 application
with just pure ES6 syntax, that wouldnt involve TypeScript - so I created this boilerplate project.

Pull requests are welcome to show more basic Angular2 functionality - http requests, routing, etc

### annotations

TypeScript and Babel treat `@Annotations` differently, and emit different JavaScript code
This example shows you how to use ES6 class static properties, instead of TypeScript annotations
